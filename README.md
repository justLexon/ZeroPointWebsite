ZPNT (later changed to NullFact0r) was an Apex Legends esports team. This website was built for a friend’s team as their first official online presence. I developed it as my first web project, showcasing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

The site featured team member pages, match schedules, announcements, and basic statistics tracking for the team. The team has since disbanded, and the site is now deprecated, but it served as an early hands-on experience in building a fully functioning esports team website.
